<img src="https://i.insider.com/5d3ac96e8d664203f053b222?width=700" alt="Saudi Arabia's capital">
<p>
Born December 21, 2001 in the capital of Saudi Arabia, I grew up in a diverse household. My father moved to Saudi with his parents from Lebanon when he was eight. My mother traveled to Saudi from the Philippines during her thirties to meet the high-demand for licensed nurses. Growing up, I attended ‚Äúinternational‚Äù institutions from kindergarten to high school. It was the norm to have over ten nationalities represented in every classroom. As I grew older and more globally aware, I realized how privileged I was to have such a relatively unique and dynamic upbringing. My life required me to work with diversity and adapt to change, preparing me for a diverse and dynamic world.

A stickler for modernity, my father bought me my first computer when I was around eight. My life quickly revolved around my computer. Growing up in the heart of authoritarian and ultra-conservative Arabia, computers felt like a portal to a limitless world. Although I lived gratefully through privileged means, my family and I always felt like my potential was limited back home.

I took the American-based SAT during my senior year. After I scored in the 99th percentile with a score of 1540/1600, I applied to America‚Äôs top colleges. Reading my letter of acceptance including my full-tuition scholarship offer to attend Miami University of Ohio, I knew something big was ahead. Adjusting to the new people, culture, language, etiquettes, and the American way of life upon coming to America was almost effortless. My upbringing prepared me for it. And here I am now.

<h2>ü™™ Professional Certifications</h2>
<details>
  <summary>Harvard‚Äôs CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</summary>
  
  - Multiple programmers recommended I enroll in this online course before going to college. Unfotunately, I came to Miami before I got the chance to finish the course. For the sake of completion, I finished the course during the winter break on January 2022. The course did a fantastic job explaining the fundamentals of problem-solving, programming, and computing in general. The course touched on eleven topics that were covered a week each: problem solving, C, arrays, algorithms, memory, data structures, python, SQL, web application programming, flask, and ethics. Every week's lecture, except the last, had a corresponding problem set, and the course culminated with a final project.
